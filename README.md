This is to show level by level right up of OverTheWire Bandit War Geams.

## Bandit 0
The goal is to use SSH to contact bandit.labs.overthewire.org on port 2220. 

I started with understanding SSH with the link provided on overthewire which took me to the SSH manual page.

In the man page I found "-p" to specify the port. Looking at how the syntax should be like this:

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

I was then prompted for a password for which I put bandit0.

I successfully gained access to the first level.
